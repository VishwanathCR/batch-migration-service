# Understanding `@StepScope` and `@JobScope` in Spring Batch 5.2

In Spring Batch, `@StepScope` and `@JobScope` are important annotations that control the lifecycle of beans in batch jobs. Here's how they work in Spring Batch 5.2:

## @StepScope

`@StepScope` creates a bean that is tied to the lifecycle of a single step execution.

### Key Characteristics:
- The bean is instantiated only when the step is executed
- Each step execution gets its own instance of the bean
- Useful for step-specific configuration and state
- Can access step execution context via late binding

### Example Usage:
```java
@Bean
@StepScope
public ItemReader<String> reader(
    @Value("#{jobParameters['inputFile']}") String file) {
    return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<String>()
        .name("itemReader")
        .resource(new FileSystemResource(file))
        // other configurations
        .build();
}
```

## @JobScope

`@JobScope` creates a bean that is tied to the lifecycle of a single job execution.

### Key Characteristics:
- The bean is instantiated when the job starts
- Each job execution gets its own instance of the bean
- Useful for job-specific configuration that needs to be shared across steps
- Can access job execution context via late binding

### Example Usage:
```java
@Bean
@JobScope
public JobExecutionListener listener(
    @Value("#{jobExecution.jobInstance.id}") Long jobId) {
    return new CustomJobListener(jobId);
}
```

## Key Differences

| Feature        | @StepScope                     | @JobScope                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Lifecycle      | Step execution                 | Job execution                 |
| Instantiation  | When step starts               | When job starts               |
| Access         | Step execution context         | Job execution context         |
| Typical Use    | Readers, writers, processors  | Job-level listeners, shared data |

## Late Binding with SpEL

Both scopes enable late binding of job/step parameters using Spring Expression Language (SpEL):

```java
@Value("#{jobParameters['paramName']}")
@Value("#{jobExecutionContext['key']}")
@Value("#{stepExecutionContext['key']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `@StepScope` for components that need step-specific state (like ItemReaders)
2. Use `@JobScope` for components that need to maintain state across multiple steps in a job
3. Avoid using these scopes for beans that don't need access to the batch context
4. Remember that scoped beans are proxied, which can affect some AOP scenarios

## Configuration Requirements

In Spring Batch 5.2, you need to ensure you have the appropriate infrastructure beans configured. The `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation (or equivalent manual configuration) sets up the necessary scope infrastructure.

These scopes are particularly important for making your batch components thread-safe and properly isolated between parallel job/step executions.
